Given a set of card (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K) which may has 4 suits spades (♠), hearts (♥), diamonds (♦) and clubs (♣). 
For simplicity, let's use A,B,C,D to notate the 4 suits and 11,12,13 to notate J,Q,K. Hearts(♥)=A, diamonds(♦)=B, clubs(♣)=C, spades(♠)=D, J=11, Q=12, K=13
Our deck will originally have 52 cards in accending order
1D, 1C, 1B, 1A, 2D, 2C, 2B, 2A, ... 13D, 13C, 13B, 13A

1. Now you are playing a card game where you are given a set of 13 random cards. Implement an efficient algorithm to sort the cards in accending order.

2. Assume you owned the whole deck of 52 cards and the deck is not in sorted order. Implement an efficient algorithm to sort the deck in accending order.
