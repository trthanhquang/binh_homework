Q1. Write a program to simulate a basic calculator.
First line is first input, second line is operator (+,-,*,/), third line 
is second output. For simplicity, assume the input, output are integer 

Sample Input 1:
*
2
3

Sample Output 1:
6

Sample Input 2:
-
6
4

Sample Output 2:
2


Q2. Your calculator will need to do more operation. First line is the 
number of operations you need to calculate. Each output line is the result
of each operation

Sample Input:
3
1 * 3
4 + 5
8 - 9

Sample Output:
3
9
-1

Q3. min, max
Given a list of N integers, find minimum and maximum in the list 
First line of input is N, followed by N integers. 
First output line is the min, second line is max

Sample Input:
10
3 4 1 2 5 3 0 4 9 -1

Sample Output:
-1
9

Q4. Top 5
Given a list of N integers, find the 5 highest number in the list. 
Print them in descending order.

First line of input is N, followed by N integers.
First output line is 5 integers in descending order

Sample Input 1:
10
3 6 4 1 7 9 10 8 5 2
Sample Output 1:
10 9 8 7 6

Sample Input 2:
20
1 3 10 4 1000 100 200 300 201 123 120 232 124 634 999 141 101 2 5 6
Sample Output 2:
1000 999 634 300 141
